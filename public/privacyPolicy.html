                        ratings and market perceptions of the businesses in which we operate; (c) changes in the regulatory framework governing
                        business generally, and the telecommunication services and equipment industry in particular, in the U.S. and other
                        countries; (d) changes in authoritative generally accepted accounting principles or policies from such standard-setting
                        bodies as the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the Securities and
                        Exchange Commission (SEC); (e) the impact of corporate governance, accounting and securities law reforms by the United
